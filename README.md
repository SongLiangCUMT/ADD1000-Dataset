# ADD1000
Abstract:
   Existing saliency prediction studies focus on exploring the universal saliency prior for natural images,relatively few on advertising images which are more creative in visual capture strategies, and incorporate various basic principles on customer praxiology, psychology, and human visual characteristics. Compared to natural images, advertising images contain more artificial scenarios and show stronger persuasiveness and deliberateness, while the impact of this scene heterogeneity on
visual attention is rarely studied.To fill this gap, we build the advertising image database, named ADD1000, recording 57 subjectsâ€™ eye movement data of 1000 ad images. It contains four categories,that is, (Calming, Exciting), (Retro, Fashional), (Aesthetic, Utilitarian) and (Emotional, Rational), totally eight attributes within four
dimensions. We expect our work to help explore the relationship between advertising vision and audience observation behavior, and further their psychological trends behind it.Please refer to the original text for more details. Welcome and thanks for your attention and quotation:
